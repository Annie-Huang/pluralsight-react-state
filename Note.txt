Uncontrolled component: React isn't controlling the selected value
    <select id="size">
Controlled component:
    <select id="size" value={size}>     << Now the select is a controlled component. (React controls the selected value).

React Event Handlers:
onClick
onChange
onHover
onBlur
onSubmit
onMouseover
etc...

When does React Render?
- state change      << Can skip render via: shouldComponentUpdate, React.memo (that say, this optimazation are rarely necessary)
- prop change       << Can skip render via: shouldComponentUpdate, React.memo, PureComponent (that say, this optimazation are rarely necessary)
- parent renders    << the same as prop change
- context change
- React won't re-render when a plain variable changes

Four ways to handle http calls:
- inline                    Call fetch/axios/etc in your component
- Centralized functions     Call separate function
- Custom hook               Create and call your own custom hook
- Library                   Call library (react-query, swr, etc)


Error boundaries do not catch errors for:
Event handlers (learn more)
Asynchronous code (e.g. setTimeout or requestAnimationFrame callbacks)
Server side rendering
Errors thrown in the error boundary itself (rather than its children)
